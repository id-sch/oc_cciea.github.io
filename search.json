Large-scale variability is represented by three indices: the status of the equatorial El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), described by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua et al. 1997); and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO, Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). Positive ONI and PDO values and negative NPGO values usually denote conditions that lead to low CCLME productivity, whereas negative ONI and PDO values and positive NPGO values are associated with periods of high CCE productivity.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nRegion     NA, NA, NA\nAdditional Information     ENSO events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity. The PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME.\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity.\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html). North Pacific Gyre Oscillation data are from E.

The SLP data are available at https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/erdlasFnWPr.html.\nAdditional Information     During the winter, periods of upwelling or, farther north, reduced downwelling can limit stratification and facilitate introduction of nutrients to the surface, acting to precondition the ecosystem for increased production in the spring (Schroeder et al. 2009; Black et al. 2010).

Monthly resolved temperature thresholds are the spatial mean of temperature values between the latitude range and from the coast out to 75 km offshore over a climatological time period of 1980-2010.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Region 1 (43.5-48°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Region 2 (40-43.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Region 3 (35.5-40°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Region 4 (30-35.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Seasonal averages of HCI.\n\n\n\n2024 Conditions\n\nMonthly MHW sum area Figure 9.1 was above the long-term mean during summer and fall 2024.\nWinter, spring and summer MHW sum area Figure 9.2 (b) had 2024 values lower than 2023.\nHeat wave cover during the winter 2024 Figure 9.2 (a) was above 1 sd, this probably can be attributed to El Niño elevating coastal temperatures Figure 8.2 (a).\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nHuang, Boyin, Chunying Liu, Viva Banzon, Eric Freeman, Garrett Graham, Bill Hankins, Tom Smith, and Huai-Min Zhang. 2021. “Improvements of the Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) Version 2.1.” Journal of Climate 34 (8): 2923–39. https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-20-0166.1.\n\n\nSantora, Jarrod A, Nathan J Mantua, Isaac D Schroeder, John C Field, Elliott L Hazen, Steven J Bograd, William J Sydeman, et al. 2020. “Habitat Compression and Ecosystem Shifts as Potential Links Between Marine Heatwave and Record Whale Entanglements.” Nature Communications 11 (1): 1–12.",

Large-scale variability is represented by three indices: the status of the equatorial El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), described by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua et al. 1997); and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO, Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). Positive ONI and PDO values and negative NPGO values usually denote conditions that lead to low CCLME productivity, whereas negative ONI and PDO values and positive NPGO values are associated with periods of high CCE productivity.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nRegion     NA, NA, NA\nAdditional Information     ENSO events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity. The PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME.\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity.\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html). North Pacific Gyre Oscillation data are from E.

Each month has a unique temperature threshold that is defined as the spatial average of all 2 m temperatures from the coast to 75 km offshore in the latitudinal region for a given month over a climatological period of 1980 to 2010 (schroeder2022?).\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) HCI 4 Regions\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: The Habitat Compression Index (HCI) measures the area of cooler water that falls below a threshold. Monthly thresholds are defined over four regions (a) within the CCLME. Each region has the bottom depth contoured, with an offshore extent of 150 km. The red line is the distance 75 km from shore that is the offshore limit of the monthly threshold definition. Separate monthly thresholds are necessary for the 4 regions due to the meridional temperature differences experienced over the CCLME. See plot (b) for the seasonal 2 m temperature means over the CCLME.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Region 1 (43.5-48°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Region 2 (40-43.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Region 3 (35.5-40°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Region 4 (30-35.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Monthly habitat compression index (HCI) for January 1980 to November ({r} cciea_yr). The index describes the contraction and expansion of cool shelf habitat between the latitude range and from the coast out to 150 km offshore. Each month the area of water below a temperature threshold is calculated where a value of 0 represents no cool water in the region and a value of 1 indicates the whole area is comprised of cool water. Monthly resolved temperature thresholds are the spatial mean of temperature values between the latitude range and from the coast out to 75 km offshore over a climatological time period of 1980-2010.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Region 1 (43.5-48°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Region 2 (40-43.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Region 3 (35.5-40°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Region 4 (30-35.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Seasonal averages of HCI.\n\n\n\n2025 Conditions\n\nNote, The data used to calculate the HCI has shifted to the NOAA SST OI product, which starts in 1983 – see (schroeder2022?) for details showing that this switch is justified.\nThe winter 2025 HCI values were average, near the long-term mean for the 3 northern regions, and above 1 sd for region 4 in the California Bight.\nSpring 2025 values were similiar, with all values within plus/minus 1 sd.\nRegion 3 summer 2025 value was lower than -1 sd, while the other 3 regions were near the long-term mean.\nAll 4 regions showed large habitat compression during fall 2025, with all regions having HCI values lower thatn -1 sd.\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nHuang, Boyin, Chunying Liu, Viva Banzon, Eric Freeman, Garrett Graham, Bill Hankins, Tom Smith, and Huai-Min Zhang. 2021. “Improvements of the Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) Version 2.1.” Journal of Climate 34 (8): 2923–39. https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-20-0166.1.\n\n\nSantora, Jarrod A, Nathan J Mantua, Isaac D Schroeder, John C Field, Elliott L Hazen, Steven J Bograd, William J Sydeman, et al. 2020. “Habitat Compression and Ecosystem Shifts as Potential Links Between Marine Heatwave and Record Whale Entanglements.” Nature Communications 11 (1): 1–12.",
