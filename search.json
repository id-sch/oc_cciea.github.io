Large-scale variability is represented by three indices: the status of the equatorial El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), described by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua et al. 1997); and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO, Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). Positive ONI and PDO values and negative NPGO values usually denote conditions that lead to low CCLME productivity, whereas negative ONI and PDO values and positive NPGO values are associated with periods of high CCE productivity.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nRegion     NA, NA, NA\nAdditional Information     ENSO events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity. The PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME.\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity.\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html). North Pacific Gyre Oscillation data are from E.

The NPH area is derived from FNMOC Sea Level Pressure (SLP) monthly means. The SLP data are available at https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/erdlasFnWPr.html.\nAdditional Information     During the winter, periods of upwelling or, farther north, reduced downwelling can limit stratification and facilitate introduction of nutrients to the surface, acting to precondition the ecosystem for increased production in the spring (Schroeder et al. 2009; Black et al. 2010).

Monthly resolved temperature thresholds are the spatial mean of temperature values between the latitude range and from the coast out to 75 km offshore over a climatological time period of 1980-2010.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Region 1 (43.5-48°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Region 2 (40-43.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Region 3 (35.5-40°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Region 4 (30-35.5°N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Seasonal averages of HCI.\n\n\n\n2024 Conditions\n\nMonthly MHW sum area Figure 13.1 was above the long-term mean during summer and fall 2024.\nWinter, spring and summer MHW sum area Figure 13.2 (b) had 2024 values lower than 2023.\nHeat wave cover during the winter 2024 Figure 13.2 (a) was above 1 sd, this probably can be attributed to El Niño elevating coastal temperatures Figure 12.2 (a).\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nHuang, Boyin, Chunying Liu, Viva Banzon, Eric Freeman, Garrett Graham, Bill Hankins, Tom Smith, and Huai-Min Zhang. 2021. “Improvements of the Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) Version 2.1.” Journal of Climate 34 (8): 2923–39. https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-20-0166.1.\n\n\nSantora, Jarrod A, Nathan J Mantua, Isaac D Schroeder, John C Field, Elliott L Hazen, Steven J Bograd, William J Sydeman, et al. 2020. “Habitat Compression and Ecosystem Shifts as Potential Links Between Marine Heatwave and Record Whale Entanglements.” Nature Communications 11 (1): 1–12.",

The spring transition index (STI) identifies the time when upwelling starts andvaries with latitude in the CCLME. The units for STI are days and a year with a small STI value will have an earlier start to the onset of upwelling winds. The length of upwelling season index (LUSI) will provide information on the duration of upwelling during a particular year. The units for LUSI are days and a larger LUSI value indicates that the upwelling season for the given year is long. The total upwelling magnitude (TUMI) measures the ultimate amount of upwelling.

Large-scale variability is represented by three indices: the status of the equatorial El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), described by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua et al. 1997); and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO, Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). Positive ONI and PDO values and negative NPGO values usually denote conditions that lead to low CCLME productivity, whereas negative ONI and PDO values and positive NPGO values are associated with periods of high CCE productivity.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nRegion     NA, NA, NA\nAdditional Information     ENSO events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity. The PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME.\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity.\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html). North Pacific Gyre Oscillation data are from E.

FNMOC produces operational forecasts of the state of the atmosphere and the ocean several times daily and maintains archives of several important parameters, such as sea level pressure and temperature. The NPH area is derived from FNMOC Sea Level Pressure (SLP) monthly means. The SLP data are available at https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/erdlasFnWPr.html.\nAdditional Information     During the winter, periods of upwelling or, farther north, reduced downwelling can limit stratification and facilitate introduction of nutrients to the surface, acting to precondition the ecosystem for increased production in the spring (Schroeder et al. 2009; Black et al. 2010). The area of sea level pressure associated with the North Pacific High (NPH) can be used as an index of this winter preconditioning (Schroeder et al. 2013).\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Area of high atmospheric pressure of the North Pacific High averaged over January and February. The area is the areal extent of the 1020 hPa isobar located in the eastern North Pacific (Schroeder et al. 2013).

Here, we further report on statistics concerning large heatwaves (LHW) which were tracked through space and time, with LHW defined as those heatwaves with an area &gt; 400,000 km2 (these denote the top 20% of all heatwaves by area as measured since 1982 when satellite data became available for tracking.

Each month the area of water below a temperature threshold is calculated where a value of 0 represents no cool water in the region and a value of 1 indicates the whole area is comprised of cool water.

Upwelling, driven by equatorward-blowing winds, is a physical process of lifting cold, nutrient- rich water from deep in the ocean to the surface. Upwelling fuels the high seasonal primary production at the base of the CCE food web. The timing, strength, and duration of upwelling vary greatly along the coast.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_UI\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_UI3, cciea_OC_UI2, cciea_OC_UI1\nRegion     NCC (45.0N, -125.0W), CCC (39.0N, -125.0W), SCC (33.0N, -119.0W)\nPublic availability statement     Source data are publicly available.\nData sources     Bakun UI is derived from geostrophic estimates of winds derived from FNMOC sealevel pressure estimates.

The spring transition index (STI) identifies the time when upwelling starts andvaries with latitude in the CCLME. The units for STI are days and a year with a small STI value will have an earlier start to the onset of upwelling winds. The length of upwelling season index (LUSI) will provide information on the duration of upwelling during a particular year. The units for LUSI are days and a larger LUSI value indicates that the upwelling season for the given year is long. The total upwelling magnitude (TUMI) measures the ultimate amount of upwelling. There may be years of short but intense periods of upwelling, or longer but weaker upwelling seasons.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_STI, cciea_OC_LUSI, cciea_OC_TUMI,\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_STI_33, cciea_OC_STI_39, cciea_OC_STI_33\ncciea_OC_LUSI_33, cciea_OC_LUSI_39, cciea_OC_LUSI_45\ncciea_OC_TUMI_33, cciea_OC_TUMI_39, cciea_OC_TUMI_45\nRegion     SCC (33.0N), CCC (39.0N), NCC (45.0N)\nPublic availability statement     Source data are publicly available.\nData sources     Bakun UI 6-hr data are downloaded from (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/erdUI396hr.html).\nAdditional Information     Bakun UI is derived from geostrophic estimates of winds derived from FNMOC sealevel pressure estimates.
